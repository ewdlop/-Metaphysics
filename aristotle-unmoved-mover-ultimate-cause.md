Aristotle's concept of the Unmoved Mover is a fundamental principle in his metaphysics. The Unmoved Mover is the ultimate cause of all motion in the universe, but it itself is not moved by anything else. It is pure actuality, without any potentiality, and is the final cause of all things.

Aristotle's concept of the Ultimate Cause is closely related to his idea of the Unmoved Mover. The Ultimate Cause is the reason for the existence and nature of all things. It is the final cause that explains why things are the way they are, and it is the ultimate explanation for the existence of the universe.
